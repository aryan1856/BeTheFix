## BeTheFix

## 🧠 Introduction:
Civic issues like potholes, broken streetlights, and garbage often go unreported due to a lack of streamlined reporting mechanisms. Our project aims to bridge this gap by providing a centralized, user-friendly platform where citizens can easily report local problems, track their status, and engage with their community. By promoting transparency, accountability, and incentivized volunteering, we strive to create a more responsive and collaborative civic environment.
